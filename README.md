# relative_pitch_adjuster

A relative pitch training app.

## Maintenance policy (important)

- **Active development target: `docs/` JavaScript version (GitHub Pages).**
- **Flutter version is no longer under active development.**
- Unless explicitly stated otherwise, all implementation requests should be handled in the `docs/` directory.

## Run the web app locally

```bash
cd docs
python3 -m http.server 4173
```

Then open `http://localhost:4173`.
